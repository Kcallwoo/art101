			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab is to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem I encountered was getting the function to print out in the console. This is because I forgot console.log(). </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>After completing the Javascipt file, I had a working function that tested which numbers in an array were odd and also calculated these numbers to the third exponent. This can be found in the console.</p>
