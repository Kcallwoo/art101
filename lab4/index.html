			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab is to pseudocode an everyday task and a computer game.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We had difficulty understanding typical language used in code which made it difficult to transfer to pseudocode.</p>
					<div id="output"></div>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We successfully wrote pseudocode for making a Ristretto coffee as well as writing out both high level and specific pseudocode for a ping poll game. Both of these were inserted into our html file.</p>
					<h3>Ristretto Coffee Steps</h3>
					<p>We made a general list of steps necessary to make a Ristretoo coffee, one of the most difficult coffees to make. This is a relatively short list to help beginners:</p>
					<center>
						<pre><code>
							<ol> 
								<li>Use 18 grams of espresso roast coffee for a double shot </li>
								<li> Grind the coffee until very fine</li>
								<li> Add the coffee grounds to an espresso basket (portafilter) until heaping over the top</li>
								<li> Place the portafilter in a folded towel</li>
								<li>Use a tamper to firmly press grounds evenly into the portafilter</li>
								<li> Ensure coffee grounds are as even as possible </li>
								<li> Place the portafilter in the espresso machine </li>
								<li>Press the button to pull the shot using Manually Mode</li>
								<li>Make sure it lasts 15 to 20 seconds and results in 1 1/2 ounces of coffee with a cream-colored crema</li>
							</ol>
						</pre></code>
					</center>

					<h3>Ping Pong Game</h3>
					<p>We chose to pseudocode a game of ping-pong. While the high level pseudocode was easy to write and understand, the more specific pseudocode in JavaScript took awhile to write out in an accurate manner.</p>
					<h4>High-Level Pseudocode</h4>
					<center>
						<pre><code>
							<ol>
								<li>Initialize game variables</li>
								<li>Print the score of players before each round</li>
								<li>Accept user input </li>
								<li> Update player 1 and 2 inputs</li>
								<li>Update ball position</li>
								<li>Check for collision with walls and paddles</li>
								<li>Test win condition based on player score of 10</li>
							</ol>
						</pre></code>
					</center>
					<h4>Javascript Pseudocode</h4>
					<pre><code>
						// Initialize player 1 score to 0  
						// Initialize player 2 score to 0  
						// Initialize ball position x axis (ball_x) to 0  
						// Initialize ball position y axis (ball_y) to 0 
						// Initialize derivative with respect to x of ball (ball_dx) to 1 
						// Initialize derivative with respect to y of ball (ball_dy) to 1 
						// Set winning score to 10 
						// Print score of each player starting at 0 
						// Loop while game running: 
							// If key “w” is pressed, player 1 score is subtracted by 1  point
								// Update player 1 score
								// Print player 1 score
							// Else-if “s” is pressed, player 1 score is added 1 point
								// Update Player 1 score
								// Print player 1 score
							// If “up arrow” is pressed, player 2 score is subtracted by 1 point 
								// Update player 2 score
								// Print player 2 score
							// Else-if  “down arrow” is pressed, player 2 score is added 1 point 
								// Update player 2 score
								// Print player 2 score
						// Update the the ball_x variable by adding the ball_dx variable to it 
						// Update the the ball_y variable by adding the ball_dy variable to it 
						// If ball_y is equal to 0
							// subtract 1 from ball_dy 
						// If ball_x is equal to 0
							// Player 2 score is added 1 point 
							// Reset ball position
						// Else if ball_x is equal to the screen width - 1
							// Player 1 score is added 1 point 
							// Reset ball position
						// If ball_x is equal to 1 and player 1 score is less than or equal to ball_y which is less than player 1 score plus the paddle
							height 
							// Multiply the current value of ball_dx by -1 which reverses the direction of the horizontal motion    
						// Else-if ball_x is equal to screen width - 2 and player 2 score is less than or equal to ball_y which is less than 
							player 2 score plus the paddle height 
							// Multiply the current value of ball_dx by -1 which reverses the direction of the horizontal motion    
						// If player 1 score is equal to 10, 
							// Print “player 1 is the winner”
						// If player 2 score is equal to 10, 
							// Print “player 2 is the winner”
					</pre></code>
