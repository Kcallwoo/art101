				<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>The challenge of this lab is to sort an inputted username and make sure it displays on the HTML file .</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem we experienced was getting the sorted username to display on the HTML file. At first, only the input box showed up but not the output.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>After using the inspect function, we were able to figure out which line of code was the issue in our Javascript file and played around with it until we got an HTML file that displays the sorted input name.</p>
